## Overview of Contract Drafting

The contract drafting workflow automates the creation of contracts by extracting relevant data and applying predefined templates. This ensures accuracy, compliance with legal standards, and reduces the time spent on manual drafting tasks.

With AI contract drafting, businesses can streamline legal workflows, improve document consistency, and minimize the risk of errors. Leveraging agentic process automation accelerates contract turnaround times and ensures that agreements meet both organizational and legal requirements.

This workflow is especially valuable for industries such as legal services, real estate, and procurement.
